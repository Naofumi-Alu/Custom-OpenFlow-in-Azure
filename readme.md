# Docker Compose

### Getting started

To quickly get started with your own installation you can use one of these docker compose files.

open a shell and cd to that folder you want save the files to, and type

```
git clone https://github.com/open-rpa/docker.git
cd docker
```

For almost everyone, you will want to start with docker-compose.yml, you do that by call normal-up.
on windows
```
normal-up.bat
```
or linux/macos
```
./normal-up.sh
```
